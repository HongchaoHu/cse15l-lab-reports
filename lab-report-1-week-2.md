## Part 2: How to log into ieng6 server computer
  First you need to know your unique usename and set password for your individual accouunt in tritonlink website. Then open the terminal from your own PC or VScode and trpe "ssh" + "cs15lsq22" + your username + "@ieng6.ucsd.edu". After hit enter, the system will ask you to type the password then you can log into your erver ieng6 work space.

## Part 5: Setting up the SSH key
  After successfully log into the server account, you can setting a SSH key for the faster future login. So first we need to generate a key from our PC and send a copy of this key to our server storage and github. Then we need to make a correct path that direct the system to our password key file everytime we try to log into the ieng6 server. By doing so, we will no longer need to type the passwrod when trying to login or send copy to the server computer. (I did not finished this part from class time and set it up later with my own mac at home)
